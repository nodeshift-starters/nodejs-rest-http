## Running The Example

You can run this example as node processes on your localhost, as pods on a local
[minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases) installation.

### Localhost

To run the basic application on your local machine, just run the commands bellow:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

If you want debug information, you can set `DEBUG` environment variable and start the application:

```
$ DEBUG=* npm start
```

This will launch the application on port 8080.

### Minishift

Minishift should be started, and you should be logged in with a currently
active project. Then run the `npm run openshift` command.

```sh
$ minishift start # You may have some options here, e.g. --memory=8096 --vm-driver=virtualbox
$ oc login -u developer # Login
$ oc new-project my-example-project # Create a project to deploy to
$ npm run openshift # Deploys the example app
```

This app has an example of integration test using an [integration test tool for Node.js apps on OpenShift](https://github.com/nodeshift/rhoaster)

Once you started your local OpenShift instance you can check it out by  running the following commands: 

```
npm run test:integration 
```

It will deploy the app to local OpenShift and run the tests located on `test/integration` directory.

```
npm run test:integration:undeploy
```

Performs undeploy of the app inside local OpenShift.

### Helm


To deploy the app via Helm you will need docker installed and a kubernetes cluster.

First build the docker image


```sh
docker build -t nodejs-rest-http:1.0.0 .
```

Once the image is built, you can deploy it to you kube cluster using helm. From within the top directory run:

```sh
helm install test-app ./nodejs-rest-http-helm
```

This deploys the app to your kube cluster and displayed some commands which you need to run inorder to be able to reach the application. Just copy paste and run them.


```sh
NAME: test-app
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Nov 12 15:33:24 2020
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=nodejs-rest-http-helm,app.kubernetes.io/instance=test-app" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  export CONTAINER_PORT=$(kubectl get pod --namespace default $POD_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort}")
  echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use your application"
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:$CONTAINER_PORT
```

To undeploy the app simply run:

```sh
helm uninstall test-app
```
